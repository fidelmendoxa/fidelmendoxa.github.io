## Lab 2 Narrative: YouTube Web Data Collection + Word Cloud Comparison

### 1 Topic + Search Parameters Used

For this lab, I explored how YouTube content differs across three major U.S. cities by collecting video data and generating word clouds.  
My topic was “What kinds of words and themes appear in YouTube search results when searching for different cities?”

**Search parameters (general):**
For the search parameters I only used the name of each city. So it was "Seattle", "Chicago" and "New York"

### 2 Why I Wanted to Make This Comparison

I wanted to compare these cities because they are all well-known, but they have very different cultural identities and media presence. I was curious if YouTube results would reflect those differences through the language used in video titles and descriptions. Since YouTube is a huge platform for tourism content, news, and entertainment, I expected each city to produce its own “digital fingerprint” through the words that show up most often.

### 3) Comparing the Word Clouds (Similarities + Differences)

Across all three word clouds, there were some general similarities that suggest YouTube search results tend to prioritize popular and high-engagement conten. Words like “tour,” “travel,” “video,” “live,” “show,” and “new” appear frequently, which makes sense because city searches often bring up tourism videos, event coverage, and general city highlights.

However, the biggest differences were between **Seattle** versus **New York/Chicago**:

- **Seattle** seemed more focused on general city terms and place-based keywords. It felt more like the content was about the city itself and common attractions.
- **New York** had a much stronger emphasis on entertainment, media, and famous people. Words like **“NYC,” “Manhattan,”** and names of well-known people showed up more than I expected.
- **Chicago** also included many celebrity names and music-related terms, which made it feel like YouTube content for Chicago was more tied to pop culture and music than Seattle.

Overall, **New York and Chicago** appeared more “celebrity-heavy” compared to Seattle, which was the most noticeable difference across the three results.

### 4) Possible Reasons for the Patterns I Observed

A few reasons might explain why New York and Chicago produced more celebrity-related terms than Seattle:

1. **Population and media visibility**

   - New York and Chicago are extremely large cities with massive national and global media attention, so they naturally have more content tied to famous people, performances, and events.

2. **Entertainment industries and cultural branding**

   - NYC especially is strongly associated with entertainment (Broadway, fashion, TV, music, nightlife), so the YouTube algorithm may surface content that matches those dominant themes.
   - Chicago also has strong connections to music culture, sports, and major touring events.

3. **Algorithmic ranking and engagement**

   - YouTube search results often prioritize what gets the most views and engagement. Celebrity-related content tends to perform well, so it may show up more often than smaller local content.

4. **Search term ambiguity**
   - Searching a city name can bring up content that is only loosely related to the place, especially if a celebrity, show, or event is strongly associated with that city.

### 5) How This Research Could Be Improved in the Future

If I were to improve this research, I would:

- **Use more specific search terms** (ex: “Seattle food,” “Chicago architecture,” “NYC public transit”) to reduce unrelated celebrity results
- **Collect a larger sample size** of videos for each city to reduce randomness and increase reliability
- **Compare results across time**, since trending topics and popular videos change quickly

### 6) What Stood Out / What Was Different From My Expectations

The biggest thing that stood out to me was how many famous people and celebrity-related words appeared for New York and Chicago, compared to Seattle. Before doing the exercise, I expected the word clouds to be mostly focused on landmarks, tourism, and general city-related keywords for all three cities. Seattle felt closer to what I expected, but New York and Chicago felt like they were being represented through entertainment and pop culture much more strongly than I thought they would be.

This made me realize that a city’s “digital geography” on YouTube is not just based on the physical place itself—it is also shaped by what the platform considers popular, what content creators produce most, and what audiences engage with the most.
